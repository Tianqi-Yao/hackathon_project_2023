One of the most sought-after crab species,\nindividuals can grow to be quite large, making them popular and easy to eat. Order\nup a Pappadeaux favorite, Alaskan King Crab Legs with a side of pasta, and you\u2019ll\nsee exactly what we mean.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nHard-Shell Crab\n\nSince the 1920s, fishermen have used crabpots to trap these crustaceans. The pots are designed only to catch larger animals, allowing the younger crab to escape and continue to grow. We prepare this seafood delicacy by boiling or steaming. Once the claws are removed, you can get at the delicate crabmeat by cracking the hard shell or carapace. The claws contain denser meat, which can be accessed by cracking them with a nutcracker. One specialty of French Quarter cuisine is stuffed crab, where the meat is removed, mixed with aromatics such as onion, bell pepper, celery and such, and then served on the shell, au gratin. Easy to eat; easy to love.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nSoftshell Crab\n\nThis is a Gulf specialty you won\u2019t want to miss. For generations, Gulf coast fishermen have caught this delicacy in the bays and shallow waters at exactly the right time, just when the crab have molted their shells. The prime season for Gulf blue crab generally runs from April until September, although the crab can be caught all year round. Every morning, the crab boats seek out the best crab grounds and lay out their trotlines and snoods. When they return and run their trotlines, they can harvest the precious catch. Softshell crab is generally prepared pan-grilled or saut\u00e9ed, but it\u2019s also delicious in a simple sandwich with a fresh tomato.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nCrawfish\n\nResembling a small lobster, this crustacean is a classic ingredient in Cajun cuisine, used in soups, bisques and \u00e9touff\u00e9es, or boiled whole with vegetables. Crawfish fishing in Louisiana goes back for generations. The fishermen set traps designed to catch crawfish only of sufficient size. There are also large commercial crawfish farms, where the crustaceans can grow under strictly controlled environmental conditions. This is important, since the quality of the crawfish is largely determined by environmental factors such as water temperature, population density, vegetation, and even the phase of the moon! The most edible part of the crawfish is the tail, though the claws also contain meat well worth digging for. Order a big plate of steaming-hot mudbugs for the whole table to share and get cracking!\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nFlounder\n\nThe delicate Gulf Flounder is a flatfish that lives inshore, primarily on sandy-bottomed bays or creeks. After it hatches, one of its eyes migrates over so both eyes are on the left side of the fish. This allows it to lie flat and wait for food to come within reach, when it pounces on its prey. Flounder can be caught with a line, but more commonly in commercial fishing, it is netted. It can be baked, saut\u00e9ed whole or filleted and is often complemented by a delicate butter or lemon sauce. It has a subtle, sophisticated flavor that makes it a gourmet favorite. For a special Pappadeaux treat, ask for our Parmesan Crusted Flounder!\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nGrouper\n\nWith its large mouth and thick body, the grouper may not be the prettiest fish in the sea, but it\u2019s a cousin to the sea bass, and a very popular choice among chefs and fish-lovers alike. While grouper can be found all over the world, chefs agree that the Gulf grouper is the best. Some years ago, the Gulf grouper was at risk of being fished out of existence. Today, it is harvested according to a catch share program that ensures a healthy, sustainable population. Individual grouper can grow to be up to 200 lbs. With its firm, lean, white flesh, the Gulf grouper is regarded as being a particularly delicious and versatile fish. Ask your server about the Grouper with Alexander Sauce. C\u2019est tres bien!\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nCaribbean Lobster\n\nThis spiny lobster can be found all through the Caribbean and the Gulf. These creatures like to hide in reefs, natural or artificial, and in mangrove swamps. Commercially, they are generally caught using traps. The prime lobster season in the U.S. stretches from August to April. Unlike its Maine cousin, the Caribbean lobster has no claws, so the edible flesh is all in the body and tail, which is often grilled. Opinions differ as to whether Caribbean or Maine lobster taste better. Why not conduct your own delicious investigation at a Pappadeaux near you?\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nMaine Lobster\n\nKnown as the king of the crustaceans, lobster is an important New England seafood delicacy, and harvesting it is controlled by strict, detailed regulation. Only lobster larger than a legal minimum can be taken, and no lobster at all can be caught between June and October. Only conventional lobster traps from boats can be used, and even commercial fishermen are limited to a maximum number of traps. Fishermen are forbidden from taking any lobster whose shell is longer than five inches, and female lobsters must be V-marked and returned to the sea. There are strict penalties for any deviation from these rules, which are an essential part of maintaining a sustainable lobster population. This prized culinary delicacy is used in bisques, soups, boils, salads and many other applications. It is probably at its most delicious simply boiled or steamed and eaten dipped in clarified butter. This brings out the sweet flavor that is the hallmark of this magnificent seafood.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nSpanish Mackerel\n\nThis tasty fish is rapidly gaining popularity in fine dining circles. The fish is found in the Atlantic, but migrates to the Gulf every spring. In order to prevent over-fishing, Federal regulations were introduced that limit where and how much the mackerel can be harvested. In the thirty years since they were introduced, these measures have resulted in a healthy and sustainable mackerel population. The meat of the mackerel is dark and delicious. It is one of the most potent sources of healthy Omega-3 fatty acids. Spanish Mackerel can be baked, broiled, steamed, smoked, poached or fried and enjoyed in combination with other seafood, for example shrimp or lobster.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nMahi Mahi\n\nHarvested from the clear waters off the coast of Costa Rica, this fish is renowned for its rich, buttery flavor. It can be prepared in many ways, including baked, grilled, broiled, fried or poached. One Pappadeaux favorite you shouldn\u2019t miss is our Blackened Mahi Alexander with shrimp and crawfish, topped with a white wine cream sauce. It\u2019s a mouthwatering celebration of the taste of New Orleans.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nBlue Point Oysters\n\nThis type of oyster is found in the Atlantic and generally served on the half-shell. Named for the Long Island town of Blue Point, where they were first gathered, this oyster can be found today along much of the New England coast. Blue Points have a firm consistency and a bright flavor, with a much-appreciated sweet and briny aftertaste.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nGulf Coast Oysters\n\nThis Gulf specialty is generally slightly sweeter than its Northern cousin. Highly prized as a winter delicacy, the gulf oyster is the perfect size to be swallowed whole. Oysters can be wild-caught by dredging or farmed. The latter method allows close monitoring of key environmental factors such as water temperature and quality. Enjoy a half dozen or a dozen with a little lemon juice or a dash of hot sauce. If you want to experience a French Quarter classic, ask your waiter about the Oysters Baton Rouge. Magnifique!\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nGulf Coast Redfish\n\nThis fish is also known as Red Drum or simply as Texas Red. Spawned in the bays around the Gulf, the fish moves out into deeper waters as it matures. Adult fish generally stay in deep water, but can sometimes, particularly during storms, be found closer to beaches or in tidal creeks. This versatile Gulf delicacy can be enjoyed baked, grilled, saut\u00e9ed or blackened. At Pappadeaux, we also serve it with Maine lobster and risotto for a special treat. It\u2019s a Lonestar classic with a French Quarter twist!\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nAtlantic Salmon\n\nSometimes known as the King of Fish, the Atlantic salmon lends itself to a broad range of preparations. Our seafood chefs prepare many succulent salmon dishes, including such Pappadeaux favorites as Cedar Plank Salmon, Crispy Salmon with Jumbo Crab & Shrimp, or Atlantic Salmon Yvette with shrimp and crawfish. Talk about delicious French Quarter flavors!\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nGulf Brown Shrimp\n\nThis Gulf shrimp has a brown shell and a slightly firmer texture than its cousin, the White Shrimp. When cooked, the shell turns a coral color. Gulf shrimp are a delicacy you simply can\u2019t deny yourself when they\u2019re in season.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nGulf Pink Shrimp\n\nGulf shrimp are among the best in the world, and the Gulf Pink is at the top of the flavor chart. Pink in its raw state, this shrimp develops a deeper red hue when cooked.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nGulf White Shrimp\n\nOften preferred by chefs, the Gulf White Shrimp has a sweet flavor and a toothsome texture. This shrimp also turns pink when cooked.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nLane Snapper\n\nSnapper is an offshore fish, often found close to the sea bottom, sometimes as deep as 300 ft. They often congregate around natural or artificial reefs such as ledges or wrecks. As they mature, these fish become more territorial and can be found in deeper waters. This fish is definitely trending on the culinary front, and for good reason. With a sweet, mild flavor that pairs well with delicate sauces, it can be enjoyed grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed. Red snapper is a very popular delicacy. For a real New Orleans classic, ask your server about our famous Red Snapper Ponchartrain.\n\nView More Seasonal Options\n\nCatfish\n\nCatfish is especially popular in the American south where it has long been a staple, whether fried or blackened.

This cold-blooded Louisiana native can weigh up to 790 lbs and 14 feet long. The largest alligator on record measured an impressive 19.2 feet! Our gators are farm-raised, which makes the meat extra tender. Alligator meat is extremely versatile, gracing tables in the form of sausage, dropped into a gumbo or jambalaya, or fried.
