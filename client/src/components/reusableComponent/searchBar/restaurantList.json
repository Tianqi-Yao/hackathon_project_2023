Despite having much of the staff focused on the event  the waiter serving us was very attentive.Tons of options on the menu here  however I strongly believe that the truffle fries plus truffle omelet is the perfect brunch combo!Wish they'd kept their parklette because outdoor seating here is quite limited and not suitable for larger groups (mostly small 2-top tables outside)."

We showed up at 6 to a mostly empty restaurant and were told there were no tables available without a reservation  although half the tables remained empty the whole time we were there. The hostess didn't look up from scrolling on her phone and didn't smile while talking and instructing us to sit at the bar while having an attitude. It was absolutely bizarre.We sat at the bar and ordered oysters  fries  and artichokes. The fries were very dry. They charged $3.25 for the smallest oysters we've ever had. So overall not really worth it."

I was lucky enough to happen by on a night that featured live music (go on Tuesday or Saturday if that floats your boat) and it really set the vibe.The menu is somewhat unique (nevertheless appealing) and I could best classify it as modern Italian. Everything was very good and the prices were more-or-less within reason. The service was fine  nothing to write home about.Overall  I look forward to enjoying another meal here in the future."

Amanda and the event team were meticulous in helping us set up. Firstly  the space is gorgeous and i would recommend to anyone to host an event here. All the staff were so kind and welcoming. Our guests all had an amazing time and are still sending us compliments about the penne vodka. I wish i could host an event here every weekend. To the entire grand vin team THANK YOU for making us feel so special."

The servers need to be flagged down vs being attentive. The meal starts off nicely with warm bread and some pesto. The pesto is a tiny bit salty but with a large piece of bread it was okay. We only ordered pasta entrees -- the pasta special -- Tagliatelle pasta with short rib ragu topped with goat cheese and shrimp risotto.The pasta special was... not that special. There is a lot of short rib but not much else. The dish lacks a good sauce base and salt. It came off too rich and oily. I was disappointed eating this and could not even eat half. My husband liked his shrimp risotto but it came with just 5 shrimps. A bit pricey for $29 to get so little shrimp and so much risotto. Ambiance here is very pretty but I'm not likely to come back due to the food quality and lack of attention from the servers."

Sea bass was amazing very fresh and juicy inside coated with fried crispy cheesed layer with lots of flavor. Capellini was good as well. Indoor vibe is amazing with live music late in the night and beautiful decors  though outside it looks a very low key restaurant. Service were light care with busy night - no over selling  chatting and the whole server team very efficiently covers most needs."

Away from the over populated Waahington St.GV has been on my list visit for a while so I'm happy my friends and I had a chance to check them out for brunch.We had a reservation for 4 people on a Sunday morning. We were quickly seated although we arrived about 10 minutes late.We scanned our QR codes to view the menu that's engraved on a wooden sign. It's a nice little touch that adds to the overall garden/farm aesthetic. (The bathrooms are well designed too!)My group ordered burgers and salads  and they seemed to enjoy their food. For me  I was in the mood for breakfast and opted for the croissant french toast  no powdered sugar  syrup on the side  with a side of scrambled egg whites.Everything was delicious! My toast had a nice crunchy exterior that was still light and fluffy on the inside. Speaking of light and fluffy  my eggs were cooked well too. I washed it all down with a sparkling water and walked away feeling satisfied. Everything was apprroatly priced so I can see myself returning. I'd be curious to try their dinner menu and have an alcoholic drink. Minus one star because the glasswear looks dirty. It's not dirty  just a result of washing dishes with the hard water we have in the area. It's gives the glasses a foggy finish that can be polished. It's not a huge deal but for a restaurant that hosts events and seems to hold itself to a higher standard  it would be nice to see the extra effort. Overall a solid experience. I'll be back."

Had to park two blocks away from the restaurant but if you get lucky cars move quickly. The service was very good overall it was just very hard to hear anything the server was saying over the loud music. -Now for the food  it was pretty good. However  my friends did not like the steak the way it was cooked or the beans that came with the dish. They said it tasted watered down.-Started with Apps: Got the chicken Skewers which were ok  not very flavorful or unique in flavor profile was not really impressed  but not terrible. We also got the Choripapa or sausage with potatoes. The baked potatoes are very crispy and well seasoned and the sausages give it a nice flavor. This was my favorite of the two  something to keep in mind; portions were small (for both apps). - I asked the server for her recommendation on the entre and she offered the \"Seco de Res\" which was pretty tender and flavorful. Very good recommendation. The mashed potatoes had a green hue  I believe they mix spinach into it but it was cool/unexpected  there was no difference in flavor however. I think I ordered the best dish out of the three because my friends were not impressed with their steaks or sides that come with it. I left feeling like I should have ordered the octopus as an app like I seen other people post about. Overall still a solid spot to check out (7.4/10). May or May not come back."

I came here for a special burlesque show and dinner they had going on this week.  So I was super excited to be there! My impression going in was like omg! It's beautiful in here! The decor  lighting  the whole place is just beautiful. Very instagram worthy. They also had Spanish music playing which I love  mainly salsa !!  Everything looks upscale and modern but not too fancy to the point of a dress and tie  if that makes sense lol. Since the event was a ticket and dinner type thing  there was a pre fix dinner menu but you were also allowed to order from the regular menu. I order the salchi papa and the seafood with macho sauce or something like that. The salchi papa   had chorizo in this flavorful sauce like something my mom or grandma would make. So you know I enjoyed that. Instead of using fries   like most  Latin Americans do with this dish. They totally made it their own with fingerling potatoes . It was delicious! The entree was ok. It came with white rice  beans and seafood in some kind of stew like sauce. I asked the server if the sauce that the dish came with   was spicy and I was told no  I was told that it's a garlic sauce. Well here is where my criticism comes in  it was spicy  for someone who doesn't like spice at all (like me) it was on the spicy side. The rice was good  shrimps were cooked perfect and so was the fish in the dish. But the sauce was too much for me. I really wish she would have been a bit more specific with her description of the sauce or just simply ask if she really didn't know. (This is the only reason I gave 4 stars)This place is very unique in a whole with their food and specially their drinks. I got a mock tail  pina colada or something similar and it was delicious. Tasted like a smoothie. I then had a mojito which was alright. The burlesque show was amazing and although it was delayed  the manger gave us a complimentary dessert for the wait and inconvenience  which was very nice. I can't wait to come again and try something else that hopefully I'll enjoy a bit more. Things to know-Great Date night spot-Parking on the street (I found some fairly quick)-The Sinatra room is downstairs in the basement and is also a good little spot to hang. Also has another bar there.-Service was great - Great for family and or big groups - Reservations should be made if going on a weekend. ( I was there on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed )"

I gave My name and phone number. We waited at the restaurant next door since they had an outdoor heater. After 15 min we went back to the hostest to see if our table were ready. They told us they had a table available but it would be a tight fit. We agreed to see it  and when we did  the table was crammed between 2 bigger parties. Everyone had to move their table for me to fit in the booth. I had to climb over someone to sit. It was a really tight fit but we delt with it. I ordered the Amish chicken and my friend ordered the steak with scrambled eggs. I also had the panela punch. The food too a really really long time to arrive. My friend wanted to leave but i was hungry. The punch was good but not worth $10 with no alcohol. The chicken was ok. It lacked a lot of flavor. It needed a sauce badly. The tacu tacu rice was too crunchy and dry for me but it had good flavor. My friend said his steak was good but they gave him powered eggs since he asked for scrambled eggs. The beans that came with his order wasnt good. It didnt go with the meal. I ordered a side of maduros thqt i sent back because they were under cooked. When i received them back  they were more well done which i liked. All in all  its an ok restaurant. I wouldn't drive over an hour to come here again. Parking is atrocious as well."

Fat taco next door is always poppin (we decided to come over here cause there wasn't a shaded spot with room for the dogs and we're glad we did) but this place is underrated. Try it."

I went in to take a peak and look at the menu   ended up going back same day .The decor :The decor is simply stunning .. loud   colorful and happy . Definitely a Party atmosphere .They have this wish tree painted on the wall but the leafs are sticky notes and you can write you own wish   a very cute touch to the place .The Bar :The bar is beautiful and our bartender Brandon was a pleasure the entire time we were there   always trying to be helpful and accommodating .The food :OMG :: they have this seasoned popcorn  .. DO NOT EAT THAT .. HAHAHA you'll get addicted to it ( the best popcorn I ever had ) .We also ordered the Pulpo   Papa Rellena and Skewed Chicken . Everything as served nice and hot . In all the experience was very pleasant and we will definitely be back . The down side : The only down side os that the bathroom is extremely out of the way downstairs and some of the tequilas and beers we asked for they didn't have ( it's a bar  you shouldn't run out of alcohol ) if the item is on the menu you should have it available . So hopefully they will work on that . All and all a great place to visit conveniently located by the path ."

We had an array of dishes and desserts and drinks and nothing fell short. Our waitress was soft spoken but she was very attentive and let us know her opinion on items. The decor of this place is fun and funny. I would come back! 50% off a classic cocktail if you check in!! Very nice perk!"

I visited around 5:30pm on a Friday and parking wasn't too hard to find.I was greeted with a warm smile as the host walked me over to the table my friend was sitting at. The decor here is beautiful! And Instagrammable I must add.My friend and I started off with drinks - we had to order the build your own margarita! I ordered house tequila with guava flavor and a mango salt rim. YUM! Love how you can customize your margs.For our apps and entrees  we shared garlic shrimp which was good but i'd skip out on it next time. I think 6 pieces of shrimp for $14 is pretty pricey. For our entrees  we ordered the tostone. I got the veggie and my friend got the chicken. We both enjoyed it  it was very filling and delicious! Overall  it was a good dinner. Would visit again! After dinner  we headed downstairs to their speakeasy...The Sinatra Room. Check out their Yelp page for my review!"

The food wasn't impressive and limited so definitely checkout the menu before you decide to take a trip. Service wasn't great besides the hostess being super nice as we were late due to traffic and limited parking."

So much flavor in all the food and I look forward to coming here again to try something new."

What a pleasant surprise!And  just the beginning of delicious surprises as the vegetarian flatbread and couscous  chickpea  avocado  kale salad arrived. Zero complaints...everything was fresh  presented beautifully and delicious. Service was great and very attentive."

Fresh fruit made everything yummy!Inside was cute  I would love to take some design ideas and bring them home!We came here for brunch and decided to sit at the bar. We thought at the bar we'd get quicker service for drinks  but at one point the bartender hadn't come over for a long time. I didn't give too low if a score because he redeemed himself at the end by giving us a free shot  but it was frustrating trying to get his attention at some points.Would still come back  just won't expect getting refills quickly."

The receptionist was very efficient over the phone when we made our reservations and super helpful when we called warning stalled traffic would make us very late. She was super cool and understanding and honored our late arrival with a seat in a great spot ... naturally  I gave her a gratuity since that's what Yelpers do! We ate a light meal from the appetizer menu... bowl of fries  wings and steak tips on a skewer. In a word  this was a great choice. The wings weren't mouth burners. The spice was light but right. The fries were golden  crispy  lightly salted and freshly fried. Yowza! And the steak tips were cooked medium rare and full of flavor. It was served on a bed of couscous (I think...) my friend loved it  I dug into a second helping of fries.One minor gripe is the volume of music played. Yeah  as a baby boomer  we were a bit past the demo for the place ... the vibe was more millennial than old fogey ! Still  the food was great. Service was spot on and prices equal to the quality. Recommended."

My fiance and I are not nearly as adventurous these days and we're much more about the food. The food I'd say is a 3/5 considering the price  quantity and taste. The items on the menu sounded really good and were creative  but the taste didn't rise to that level. The Fried Chicken Sandwich was our favorite  the chicken was fried perfectly. The others  Buffalo Chicken Bites  Sweet Salty Spicy Flatbread and Crispy Rice & Spicy Tuna were good but not amazing. I also had a Iryna's Lavender cocktail  which was delicious. I really like that the ice cube isn't just water but the actual drink so it doesn't water down the drink. I would bring friends here to hang but I probably wouldn't come here again with just me and my fiancé for a Friday dinner. Btw we had to get the reservations a week out  spots do fill up. Our waiter was pretty good."

HUGE!!!With that said  they have plenty of seating whether at the bar or for dining experience. The ambiance and atmosphere is impeccable... very detailed and has that lively feel. I heard on certain nights it gets PACKED!The drink options are quite tasty. Handcrafted cocktails that give your taste buds some fun.The food on the other hand... complete opposite. Tried some items and they underwhelmed. Buffalo chicken tasted generic. I could have gotten this at a fast food joint. Also had the nachos (no pic)... don't do it. It's more of a taco salad than to be called nachos. Even though it was decent  I am just giving you the heads up that it by no means \"nachos\" standard.Definitely a great hangout spot to mingle and spend time with friends  but come for the atmosphere and drinks  just not the food."

Not the best eggs benedict I've had - the eggs wasn't runny at all and the english muffin was a little burnt  but everything still tasted great!! The real star of the show was the brunch cocktails. One of the best cold brew / espresso martinis I've had in the area. Rich flavor and strong  but not a strong taste of alcohol. The Yeats Spritz was a great drink as well  with an amazing presentation.The Service here was amazing  the staff was all so friendly  checked in with us at a good cadence  etc. Cute decor and ambiance  dressed up casual spot - great for a brunch reunion with friends or a date! Lots of cute light and vibe decorations."

My friends and I came for a Friday night and the place was full of energy  very crowded all you want in a Friday night hangout. We started with some cocktails and apps. My friend got the \"Pornstar Martini\" and I ordered the Adam's Curse or was it David's Curse? I forget the name but it has the word Curse in it that is for sure. The \"Cursed\" drink was definitely the winner very refreshing with Raspberry forward flavor and some rosemary made it very earthy and yummy. The martini was very lacking in both flavor and color from the other review pictures I've seen it did not look right. We shared a Margarita flatbread and Buffalo chicken bites. The flatbread was very dry and almost too crunchy like it was a bit overdone. The Buffalo chicken bites were better but nothing special just an average Buffalo chicken flavored app. Again  not knocking it  it was actually the better app of the two. Will have to come back to see if they have more impressive selections. Did enjoy the time we had here so give it a try  and I will be back to try more!"
